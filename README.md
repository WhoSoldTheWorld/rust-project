My project is a benchmarking tool that I was trying to use to benchmark the client of a game that I waste most of my time playing, my program also shows information reguarding running processes.

The main feature is the benchmarking of commands and executable, I also included a wait flag so that I can have the benchmark wait for me to start something something or interact with something. My program also lists active processes and their CPU and Memory usage.
